        <p>Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature,
            about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a
            copy of the drawing.
            In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not
            able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."
            I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I
            succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:
            I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.
            But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"
